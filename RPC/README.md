# HATS

## Introduction
Hardware Automated Test System (HATS) is a hardware testing tool designed to be user-friendly and portable across ARM Mbed enabled devices. The tool is catered to maximize user-friendliness, minimizing the need to have prerequisite knowledge on embedded programming to perform tests.

It consists of 2 parts:

* Analogue Testing
* Digital Testing

## Documentation and References
* Confluence page for HATS: https://siotteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MNC/pages/690323704/HATS

## Limitations
* Mbed RPC only seems to run on Mbed OS 5.9.3 with Mbed online compiler
* In order to use the code, download and import the zip mbed rpc file into mbed comnpiler
* Do not change/update the mbed-os once source code has been inported into the mbed compiler
